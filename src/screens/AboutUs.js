        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
         Our goal is to raise awareness towards accessibility by providing easy access to accessibility information that is usually unknown to the public until they actually visit the store, and using the platform as a way to inspire businesses to do all they can to include everyone.

         The Access Wayfinder team is spearheaded by Krishav Singla, a Westfield resident and current high school senior. Inspired by his personal encounters with his wheelchair-using grandparents and friend, he decided to do something to counteract the mystery of accessibility. Collaborating with Mayor Brindle, the Downtown Westfield Corporation, and college freshman Sarah Maher, he conducted surveys and interviewed over 130 businesses in Westfield. He then worked alongside high school junior Ethan Lung to develop a user-friendly app for iOS and Android.

         This app allows users to explore ratings and key accessibility details of local businesses. The app is currently organized in multiple categories and in an A to Z order within each category, but we hope to implement a search bar soon. The future vision includes expanding to other towns globally and reaching as many users as possible. Thank you for joining us on our mission to enhance accessibility for everyone.

       <Text style={styles.info}>
         Krishav is a senior at the Union County Magnet High School. After venturing through downtown Westfield with his grandfather, he saw from a different lens how inaccessible some of the vibrant restaurants or relaxing spas were. While he didnâ€™t think twice about a couple of steps in front of the entrance, it changed the whole landscape for his grandfather. He was inspired to pursue Access Wayfinder after talking to other seniors and veterans who struggle with accessibility, and wanted to make the world a better place for them.
